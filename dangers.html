          <h2>Jellyfish Lake</h2>
		  
		  <p><em>Jellyfish Lake</em> is a lake located in  Eil Malk island in Palau. Though this is a lake filled with jellyfish with stinging cells, this location is still considered a tourist location for people to swim with the jellyfish. This may seem dangerous, but with proper equipment swimmers will be safe because the jellyfish in this lake (moon and golden jellyfish) only have mild stings. </p>

          <h2>Irukandji syndrome</h2>
		   <p>Irukandji Jellyfish are tiny jellyfish that live in Australia. Though they are small, they can cause severe stings or even death, if untreated. They have the ability to shoot their stingers out at their victim which causes a phenomenon known as <strong>Irukandji Syndrome.</strong> 
		   The symptoms are:
		   <ul>
			   <li>severe headache</li>
			   <li>backache</li>
			   <li>severe muscle pains</li>
			   <li>chest pains</li>
			   <li>abdominal pains</li>
			   <li>nausea, vomiting</li>
			   <li>anxiety</li>
			   <li>hypertension</li>
			   <li>tachycardia</li>
			   <li>pulmonary edema</li>
		   </ul>
		   Because there is no anti-venom available, treatment for this syndrome is limited to strong painkillers and flushing the area with vinegar.

          <h2>Sea Wasps</h2>
		   <p>A type of box jellyfish known as <em>Chironex fleckeri</em>, or <strong>Sea Wasp</strong>. Thse are known as the most lethal jellyfish in the world. Their stings are excruciatingly painful and if untreated, a severe sting may cause death in 3 minutes. They are virtually transparent, and therefore are hard for swimmers to spot. There is an antivemon available after immediate treatment by dousing the sting in vinegar if the swimmer manages to get to help in time. Fortunately, not all stings are severe enough to cause death, but extreme caution should be used swimming in areas where these jellyfish live.</p>
