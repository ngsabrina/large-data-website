          <p>The <em>Moon Jellyfish</em> is one of the most common types of jellyfish in the ocean. It is also known as <strong>Aurelia aurita</strong>. This jellyfish has a translucent body and usually has 4 horseshoe shaped <em>Gonads</em> on the top of its body. They eat small sea creatures such as plankton and molluscs. In the wild, these jellyfish don't often live longer than six months, due to disease and lower ammounts of food available for these creatures. In capitivity, however, the optimal living conditions allow them to live up to a few years. These jellyfish have a painless/mildly painful sting on humans. <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/danger-green.svg" class="danger-level" alt="harmless, or mildly painful sting"></p></p>
