        <h1>What's a Jellyfish?</h1>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Jellyfish</strong> are sea creatures that swim freely about in the ocean. They've earned the fun nickname <em>Jellies</em> and they have flowing tentacles and a bell-shaped body. They're spineless creatures of the <em>Cnidaria</em> phylum but that doesn't mean they can't pack a punch. Some jellyfish are very dangerous and their stings can cause some serious damage to unknowing swimmers. Jellyfish can even be used as food for those of us who have a more adventurous palate. Jellyfish are graceful and beautiful, and there's a lot of great diagrams and photography about them to see and learn about. </p>
