## Observations
The participants commonly were confused by certain scientific title topic cards, as it would probably take someone who is an expert/did research about jellyfish to recognize them. Their main questions were related to that, for example, *what is a hydrozoa?* The easiest topic for them to understand, and the one that was most commonly grouped together was the different jellyfish breeds (ex: *white spotted jelly, moon jelly*). The groupings were generally similar. The only difference was when the participant didn't know what something was so they put it in its own category, for example in card sort 2, *sea wasp* was put under *other sea creatures*, when, despite its misleading name, is a type of jellyfish as well. Besides simple mistakes like that the groupings were pretty expected, and generally similar to what I had expected. I felt fine when watching them perform the task, their sortings were generally to my expectations so I believe it went well.
