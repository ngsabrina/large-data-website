        <h1>Types of Jellyfish</h1>
        <p class="lead">There are different types of jellyfish besides the common, round-shaped bell types. These stand out compared to the basic jellyfish because of their appearance of behaviours. Some basic examples are: Hydrozoa, Stauromedusae, and Box Jellyfish. </p>

          <h2>Hydrozoa</h2>
          <p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/hydrozoa.jpg" class="flex-img" alt="hydrozoa"><strong>Hydrozoa</strong> are creatures under the same phylum as jellyfish, <em>Cnidaria</em>, and contain many jellyfish and coral species. Mostly, they live in saltwater, however, there are some freshwater species that exist. An example  of a jellyfish that falls under the Hydrozoa category is the freshwater jellyfish called the <em>Craspedacusta sowerbii</em>. This jellyfish is different from non-hydrozoa jellyfish because it has a muscular velum on the surface of its body. </p>

          <h2>Stauromedusae</h2>
          <p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/stauromedusae.jpg" class="flex-img" alt="stauromedusae"><strong>Stauromedusae</strong> are very unique compared to other jellyfish. These jellyfish types are distinctive because they are the only ones left of their kind. They are often called stalked jellyfish because they look upside-down in comparison to other jellyfish. This is because their tentacles float upwards from their bodies instead from the stalk in the center of their body. They usually live close to the shoreline instead of deeper in the water like most jellyfish. Also, they tend to attach themselves to the shoreline or other sea objects instead of free floating around like other common jellyfish. </p>

          <h2>Box Jellyfish</h2>
          <p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/box-jelly.jpg" class="flex-img" alt="box jellyfish"><strong>Box Jellyfish</strong> have a box type bell instead of a round one like most other jellyfish. They are also known as <em>Sea Wasps</em> because they produce a very painful, and sometimes fatal, sting when they come in contact with humans. </p>
