The *purple-striped jelly* (*Chrysaora colorata, formerly Pelagia colorata*) is a species of jellyfish that exists primarily off the coast of California in Monterey Bay. The bell (body) of the jellyfish is up to 70 cm (27.6 inches or 2.3 feet) in diameter, typically with a radial pattern of stripes. The tentacles vary with the age of the individual, consisting typically of eight marginal long dark arms, and four central frilly oral arms. It is closely studied by scientists due to not much being known about their eating habits.
Often young *Cancer crabs* make home in the jellyfish and eat the parasitic amphipods that feed on and damage the jelly.
