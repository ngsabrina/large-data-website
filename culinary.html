          <p><strong>Jellyfish</strong> can be used for culinary purposes for those of us who have an adventurous palete. That being said, jellyfish are usually eaten as a delicacy in Japan and Korea. The safest way to eat jellyfish is to have them dried first, because they can go back very quickly and make you sick. Usually they will go bad in only a few hours so those who harvest jellyfish for food purposes need to work fast. However there are only very specific types of jellyfish that can be harvested. They are called <em>Rhizostomae</em> type jellyfish, and even within that type of jellyfish, only a small amount can be eaten by human. Other jellyfish have too many harmful toxins that could make humans sick if they ate them. In general, the process to eat jellyfish involves cutting them and drying them into salty strips, which are later rehydrated by soaking in water for a few hours. Then, they can be served with soy sauce or other sauces like vinegar to make them more flavourful. Often, the entire process of harvesting jellyfish for consumption can take up to 20 days if done correctly! That's a long time for this unique delicacy! </p>
